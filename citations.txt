Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.
